Amazon web services

Amazon sage maker : Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, 
data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, 
and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. 

benifits : 
  reduces machine learning data costs
  AI/ML components are stored in one place
  Highly scalable
  Trains model faster
  Maintains uptime
  High data sequrity 
  easy data trasfers
  
  
 * CUstomize ML models with jupyter note books
 * it devides the training data and stores in Amazon S3, where as the training algorithm stored 
 in ECR
 * Later sagemaker sets up a cluster for the input data, trains it and stores it in Amazon s2 itself.
 * Once tuning is done models can be deplyed into sage maker endpoints
 * In the endpoints, real-time prediction is performed.
 

  Make a Docker file which is compatible for sagemaker

  Permissions
  
  Have to create new repositories in Amazon ECR
  The easiest way to add these permissions is simply to add the managed policy AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess to the role that you used   to start your notebook instance
